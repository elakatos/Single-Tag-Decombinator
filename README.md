# Single-Tag-Decombinator
Currently in development.

Based on scripts by Tom Peacock at [Innate2Adaptive](https://github.com/innate2adaptive/Single-Tag-Decombinator). Used for detecting and decombining TCR tags in relatively short sequencing reads (where detecting V and J segment tags simultaneously is unlikely).
Modifications include adjustment to our local computing cluster and further scripts required to apply for raw RNAseq data with limited T-cell content.
